**Arveed** is **Cyril Vall√©e**'s blog. (That's me.)  
I am a <a href="https://www.cyrilvallee.com">fiction writer</a> and <a href="https://www.h-fr.ch/nos-formations/centre-de-formation-des-soins">technology educator</a>.<br> I write genre fiction: <a href="https://www.cyrilvallee.com/totem-un-thriller/">thrillers (in french)</a>, <a href="https://www.cyrilvallee.com/le-reflet-des-etoiles/">science fiction (in french)</a>, and <a href="https://www.cyrilvallee.com/timeskippers/">fantasy</a> (also in french, I'm afraid). If you want to know more, visit <a href="https://www.cyrilvallee.com/">my official website</a>. There you'll also find a link to subscribe to my newsletter. As a bonus, you'll get free stories (who doesn't like gifts?) That is, _if you read french_.

This site is a simpler, statically generated mirror that I hope will be long-lasting, of my official website [cyrilvallee.com](https://www.cyrilvallee.com/). It also contains more personal articles related to interests beyond literature and writing.

I blog mainly in french, but I intend to publish more in english.

## Short bio

Here's what my author website bio says:

> Cyril was born in 1973. He lives in Switzerland with his family.  
> Long involved in emergency services professionally, he discovered writing through developing a > screenplay, coached by Jean-Marie Roth. It was a revelation that became a passion for over twenty years: telling stories through his writing.  
> After a first thriller and a venture into science fiction, he is currently working on a new thriller.
